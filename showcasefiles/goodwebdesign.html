        <h1>Good Web Design</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="writeup">
            <p>Let's go over an example of good web design. The website we chose to showcase is
                <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>,
                a company and website to help others improve user interface design.
            </p>

            <p>
                The website is consistent in its design throughout by using the same font, colours, and overall format.
                Everything looks like it belongs, and nothing looks irregular or out of place.
            </p>

            <p>
                This navigation bar is consistent in every page of the website.
                It also includes a home page button in the form of the company logo on the very left,
                this allows for easy navigation back to the home page from everywhere else on the website.

            </p>

            <p>
                The website is made to work well and feel natural no matter the size of the user's device.
                Some of the buttons even resize themselves by shortening the text inside.
                For mobile users, the navigation bar is fully redesigned to be a new menu to allow for easy access.
