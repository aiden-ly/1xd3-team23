        <h2><a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma.com</a></h2>
        
        <p>This website incorporates many good user interface principles. 
            The website is consistent in its design throughout by using the same font, colours, and overall format.
            It is extremely easy to navigate, with the navigation bar being at the top in every page.
        </p>

        </p>
            There's a home page button in every page of the website to allow for quick and easy navigation.
            The website is made to work well and feel natural no matter the size of the user's device.
            Buttons both resize and dissappear when needed, and the navigation bar is fully redesigned for mobile users.
            Some of the buttons even resize themselves by shortening the text inside.
