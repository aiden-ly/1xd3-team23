        <h1>Bad Web Design</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="writeup">

            <p>Let's go over an example of bad web design. The website we chose
                to showcase is our very own university's 
                <a href="https://www.oscarplusmcmaster.ca/myAccount/dashboard.htm">
                OscarPlus Job Board.</a>
            </p>
            <img src="../images/oscarplus1.png">

            <p> We are greeted with a website a website that, for some reason, has
                two different navigation bars for the exact same webpages, despite
                being in different design schemes too. This can be confusing for users as it 
                creates redundancy and inconsistency in navigation. 
            </p>

            <img src="../images/oscarplus2.png">

            <p> Scrolling down a bit more on the dashboard, we see a row of links that
                all have images that have failed to load. Even though the website has a
                few faults, at least it's consistent in design, right?
            </p>

            <img src="../images/oscarplus3.png">

            <p> Wrong. Going to the co-op section of the Engineering tab shows us a page
                with a completely different design and colour scheme. Rather than using
                McMaster's iconic maroon colours again, it uses purple, along with a
                different font. All of the divs seem to be round as well, unlike the
                blocky structure we saw earlier.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/oscarplus4.png">

            <p> It's not even consistent within it's own section! Now, let's go over it's
                "responsive" design.
