                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>It is a productivity app that is designed to help university students, 
                    but can be used by anyone, to help manage their classwork and time. 
                    We plan to include features such as a to-do list, a built-in Pomodoro timer,
                    an assignments list sorted by priority, dark mode, trend charts to track 
                    your progress, and a calendar view for all tasks.
                </p><br>

                to be related to a specific course/assignment) with a checkbox, showing if 
                it is completed or not. Fields: Name (TEXT, PRIMARY), Description (TEXT), Completed (BOOLEAN).</p><br>

                <p><strong>Tasks/Assignments: </strong>A list of all of the tasks the user adds so that
                they can easily see an overview of what they need to do and which assignments to 
                tackle first. It will store each task which will each have their own due date and priority.

                Priority (TEXT), Completed (BOOLEAN).</p><br>
